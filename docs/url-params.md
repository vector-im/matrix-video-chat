# Url Format and parameters

There are two formats for Element Call urls.

- **Current Format**

  ```text
  https://element_call.domain/room/#
  /<room_name_alias>?roomId=!id:domain&password=1234&<other params see below>
  ```

  The url is split into two sections. The `https://element_call.domain/room/#`
  contains the app and the intend that the link brings you into a specific room
  (`https://call.element.io/#` would be the homepage). The fragment is used for
  query parameters to make sure they never get sent to the element_call.domain
  server. Here we have the actual matrix roomId and the password which are used
  to connect all participants with e2ee. This allows that `<room_name_alias>` does
  not need to be unique. Multiple meetings with the label weekly-sync can be created
  without collisions.

- **deprecated**

  ```text
  https://element_call.domain/<room_name>
  ```

  With this format the livekit alias that will be used is the `<room_name>`.
  All people connecting to this URL will end up in the same unencrypted room.
  This does not scale, is super unsecure
  (people could end up in the same room by accident) and it also is not really
  possible to support encryption.
